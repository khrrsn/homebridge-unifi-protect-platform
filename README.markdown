## Installation

TODO

### Supported Features

Unlike other UniFi Homebridge platforms, this platform provides realtime events and does not poll at set intervals. This means youâ€™ll get doorbell and motion events pushed to HomeKit instantaneously.

- Camera
- Doorbell Events (Push)
- Motion Event (Push)

### Tested Devices

- UDM-Pro
- UVC-G3
- UVC-G3-Dome
- UVC-G4-Doorbell

## Configuration

TODO

## TODO

- Two Way Audio
- Move off of RTSP

## Development

### Environment

All development tooling dynamically configures Homebridge through environment vars that should be set to match your environment. These values can be found in the [dev/start.ts](./dev/start.ts) file.

A `.env` file is supported in the root of the project directory.

### Tools

`homebridge-unifi-protect-platform` has some tooling to help making development easier:

- `yarn dev` will launch Homebridge through TypeScript pointed towards `src`
- `yarn dev:stream` displays all events emitted from the controller
