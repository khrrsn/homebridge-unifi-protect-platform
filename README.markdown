- Motion Event (Push)

### Tested Devices

- UDM-Pro
- UVC-G3

## To Do

- [ ] Two Way Audio
- [ ] Move off of RTSP

## Development

### Environment

All development tooling dynamically configures Homebridge through environment vars that should be set to match your environment. These values can be found in the [dev/start.ts](./dev/start.ts) file.

A `.env` file is supported in the root of the project directory.

### Tools

`homebridge-unifi-protect-platform` has some tooling to help making development easier:

- `yarn dev` will launch Homebridge through TypeScript pointed towards `src`
- `yarn dev:stream` displays all events emitted from the controller
- `yarn dev:inspect` displays an output of your current Protect enviroment
